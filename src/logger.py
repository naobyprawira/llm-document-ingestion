"""Logging helpers and global configuration.

This module centralises the projectâ€™s logging setup and exposes a thin
``get_logger`` helper that injects ``job``, ``file`` and ``phase`` keys into
log records.  It also defines a handful of configuration constants read
from the environment.  Other modules import these constants rather than
parsing environment variables repeatedly.
