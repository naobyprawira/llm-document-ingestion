"""
Prompt definitions for image description using the visual language model (VLM).

This module contains helper functions that return text prompts used
by the ``GeminiVLM`` to guide image descriptions. Keeping prompts
centralised makes it easier to adjust the behaviour of the model
without scattering strings throughout the codebase.
